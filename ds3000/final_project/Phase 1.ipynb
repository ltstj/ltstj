    "The NBA has evolved drastically over the years. The newest era being controlled by the three pointer. However, at a time, there was no three pointer, only added in 1979. Since then, the amount of three's being taken per game has been on an incline, especially since the greatest shooter of all time, Stephen Curry, reached his prime in the league. What I wish to analyze is the variance of efficiency throughout the different teams shooting teams in the NBA. Furthermore, I want to find out if there is a correlation between the three point percentage for a team and their success throughout the season. These answers can be used for multiple reasons, for example, a team with a lower efficiency of threes can try to align their play style to a team that shoots threes at a very efficient rate. To add on, the second question can give teams a better idea on how many threes to really take per game to make the most out of the extra point and give them the competitive edge."

    "I can use this data to answer my question by comparing the amount of three pointers attempted and the three point percentage and create graphs to see what teams are shooting the most efficiently. As for my second question, the 3 pointers attempted can be compared to the offensive efficiency of each team and determine which team uses the three point line to the most of its ability by using logistical regression graphs or something similar, a supervised machine learning technique. The methods of what graphs or techniques I might use to solve my questions may change as the year goes on as I do not know too many machine learning methods yet. If I learn any relevant unsupervised methods, I will try to incorpate them into my results as well."
