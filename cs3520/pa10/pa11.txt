Practice Activity 11
  â€‹The purpose of the intramural sports management software is to keep track of university members' 
participation in them. The platform will store member details including names, email ids, addresses
membership type, and particular club and sports interests. The program will also be able to track 
their performance, keep a database of their actions, and document their involvement in different 
sporting events and tournaments.
  The system's main features are allowing members to register, updating their personal information, 
following their attendance at events, logging performance metrics, and providing comprehensive 
reports on their actions. All kinds of membership are supported by the software. 
The simple design of the user interface makes it easier for administrators and members 
to track activity and manage their information.
