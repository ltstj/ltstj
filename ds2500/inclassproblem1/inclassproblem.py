Code from class -- student loan data from one month

Questions to ask/answer:
    - avg amount owed per person, overall
    - avg amount ower per person, in a given state
    - state with min/max # borrowers
    - state with min/max total balance
    - avg # borrowers over all states
    - avg balance over all state
    - correlation between num borrowers and balance
    
Functions sketch:
    - read file
    - iterate over the dataset
    - clean (string ==> floats)
    - min/max function
    - total function. separately compute avg
